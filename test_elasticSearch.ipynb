Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with Sansa and Arya Stark.\\n\\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor Rory McCann in the HBO television adaptation.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of Gregor Clegane, and was a retainer to House Lannister. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3bfe802b60db7c49f07786e26a463ad8'}>,\n",

He abhors brothels and once tried to have them banned from King\\'s Landing, which made him unpopular with the smallfolk there. He dresses plainly in dark clothing and is rarely seen without his sword and dagger.

Sketches would be in black and white with the aim of identifying the correct style, tone of voice, scale and detail, for approval by HBO and Tourism Ireland. Once approved, the line drawings would pass through the colourisation phase. The colourisation phase is a lengthy process of converting the monochrome designs into a coloured piece of illustrated artwork. This process considers line widths, contrasts and resolution and also identifies the correct colour palette to use per section.\\n\\n=== Weaving ===\\nThe illustrated artwork is then passed to a hand-weaving specialist.

The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, near Holywood, County Down, was used as the secret location for this work.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story.

In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.\\n\\n===Inspirations and derivations===\\nAlthough the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the series is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\".\\n\\nThe novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history.

During their journey, Tyrion is kidnapped by Daenerys' former advisor Jorah Mormont, who aims to redeem himself to Daenerys by bringing her the dwarf. However, Tyrion and Jorah are captured by slavers, whom Tyrion convinces to sell them to the fighting pits in Meereen. During a demonstration of pit fighters, Tyrion and Jorah encounter Daenerys; she decides to take Tyrion into her service, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the re-opening of Meereen's fighting pits, the insurgency known as the Sons of the Harpy launch a massive attack, which is only thwarted when Daenerys' dragon Drogon appears and scares off the Sons, before riding off with Daenerys on his back.

As the camera swoops across the map and focuses on the locations in which the episode's events take place, complicated clockwork mechanisms cause buildings and other structures to emerge from the map and unfold.
